/*************************************************************************
 * CommandLineToArgvA            [SHELL32.@]
 *
 * MODIFIED FROM https://www.winehq.org/ project
 * We must interpret the quotes in the command line to rebuild the argv
 * array correctly:
 * - arguments are separated by spaces or tabs
 * - quotes serve as optional argument delimiters
 *   '"a b"'   -> 'a b'
 * - escaped quotes must be converted back to '"'
 *   '\"'      -> '"'
 * - consecutive backslashes preceding a quote see their number halved with
 *   the remainder escaping the quote:
 *   2n   backslashes + quote -> n backslashes + quote as an argument delimiter
 *   2n+1 backslashes + quote -> n backslashes + literal quote
 * - backslashes that are not followed by a quote are copied literally:
 *   'a\b'     -> 'a\b'
 *   'a\\b'    -> 'a\\b'
 * - in quoted strings, consecutive quotes see their number divided by three
 *   with the remainder modulo 3 deciding whether to close the string or not.
 *   Note that the opening quote must be counted in the consecutive quotes,
 *   that's the (1+) below:
 *   (1+) 3n   quotes -> n quotes
 *   (1+) 3n+1 quotes -> n quotes plus closes the quoted string
 *   (1+) 3n+2 quotes -> n+1 quotes plus closes the quoted string
 * - in unquoted strings, the first quote opens the quoted string and the
 *   remaining consecutive quotes follow the above rule.
